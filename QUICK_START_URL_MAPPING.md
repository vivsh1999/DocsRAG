# Quick Start Guide: URL Mapping Solution

## What Was Fixed

The LLM now correctly maps sources to documentation links by:

1. **Reading Docusaurus metadata** to get actual frontend URLs
2. **Storing frontend URLs** in document metadata during processing
3. **Using accurate links** in source attribution instead of guessing

## How to Test the Solution

### Step 1: Build Docusaurus (Required)
The URL mapper needs Docusaurus metadata files, so build the docs first:

```bash
cd apps/docs
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Setup Test Data (Optional)
Copy real Docusaurus content to test with actual documentation:

```bash
cd apps/api
npm run setup-test-data
```

### Step 3: Test URL Mapping
Verify the URL mapping functionality works:

```bash
npm run test-url-mapping
```

### Step 4: Start the API Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## What You'll See

### Before the Fix
```
Sources:
1. **architecture.md (System Architecture)** (87.3% match)
```

### After the Fix
```
## üìö Sources

1. **[architecture.md](/docs/api/architecture)** - System Architecture `api`
   - üìç Path: `docs/api/architecture.md`
   - üéØ Relevance: 87.3%
   - ‚úèÔ∏è [Edit this page](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/docs/api/architecture.md)
```

## Key Improvements

- ‚úÖ **Clickable source links** that work in the frontend
- ‚úÖ **Accurate URLs** based on Docusaurus routing
- ‚úÖ **Edit links** for contributor workflow
- ‚úÖ **Rich metadata** with categories and relevance scores
- ‚úÖ **Fallback support** when metadata unavailable
- ‚úÖ **Type-safe implementation** with full TypeScript support

## How It Works

1. **URL Mapper Service** reads `.docusaurus/` metadata files
2. **Document Processor** enriches documents with frontend URLs
3. **Vector Store** uses accurate URLs in source attribution
4. **LLM responses** include proper links that users can click

## Testing in the Chat Widget

After implementing this solution, when users ask questions in the chat widget, the source links will correctly point to the actual documentation pages instead of broken or incorrect URLs.

## Production Deployment

For production, ensure:
1. Docusaurus is built before the API starts
2. The URL mapper can access `.docusaurus/` metadata files
3. Consider caching URL mappings for better performance

## Troubleshooting

**URL mapper not initialized**: Make sure Docusaurus is built first
**No frontend URLs found**: Verify the Docusaurus metadata files exist
**Links still broken**: Check that the `frontend_url` metadata is being set correctly
